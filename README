Iterated Social Choice
===========

Provides functions to evaluate the "satisfaction-weighted average without misery" technique to provide a group of persons with a sequence of items customised for their preferences.

This method works in an iterative form: to select each item, the preferences and satisfactions of each person are considered, and the item with the highest average preference is selected. 
The average excludes elements that fall below a "misery" threshold of individual preference.
The average also assigns different importance to different persons according to how much they have been satisfied so far by the items selected.
After one item has been selected, individual satisfaction degrees are updated and the selection for the next item begins.

At the moment, he individual preferences of the persons are randomly generated.

State
=======

In development

To do
=======

* Create a proper R package
* Import preferences from real persons
* Return data analysis such as variance

Methods
=======

 exp0

Plots preferences and satisfactions for the default parameters

 exp1

Shows how the number of persons affects individual satisfaction.
Hypothesis: the more the persons, the smaller their satisfactions.

 exp2

Shows how the number of retrieved items at each turn affects satisfaction.
Hypothesis: the more the retrieved items, the higher the satisfaction.
Note: increasing the retrieval size can be expensive

 exp3

Shows how the misery threshold affects the group preference.
Hypothesis: the higher the threshold, the smaller the group preference

 exp4

Shows how weighting by satisfaction affects the variance of satisfaction
Hypothesis: assigning at each turn a higher importance to less satisfied persons provides more fairness, resulting in a smaller variance between individual satisfactions
 
 exp5

Shows how the satisfaction decay affects the satisfaction
Hypothesis: none

 exp6

Shows how the individual satisfaction affects the satisfaction
Hypothesis: none
